This project is an online platform designed to provide the easiest and fastest bus ticket purchasing process for travelers. It consolidates trips from different companies in various cities into a single platform, helping users find the most suitable ticket. The project is developed using C# and PostgreSQL.

The platform allows users to filter bus details, select seats, purchase tickets, and receive a receipt after payment. Additionally, it provides features for administrators to manage branches of the company, add, update, and delete trips, and handle and control expenses.
